# RAG Retrieval System Fixes

## Problem Identified
Your RAG system wasn't finding relevant chunks for queries like "Where was Aryabhata born?" even though the answer existed in chunkIndex 4. The issue was **vector similarity search failure**, not chunking problems.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Pronoun Reference Issue**: Content "He was born in 476 CE at Kusumapura" doesn't directly connect to "Aryabhata"
2. **Query Style Mismatch**: Question format vs statement format semantic gap
3. **Low Similarity Scores**: Vector embeddings weren't capturing the relationship
4. **Single Retrieval Strategy**: Only using vector search without fallbacks

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced RAG Service (`backend/src/services/ragService.ts`)
- **Query Expansion**: Automatically rephrases queries to match content style
  - "Where was Aryabhata born?" → ["Aryabhata birth place", "Aryabhata was born", "birth of Aryabhata"]
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines vector similarity + keyword search
- **Multiple Retrieval Methods**: Vector, keyword, and hybrid approaches
- **Lowered Similarity Threshold**: From default to 0.2 for better recall

### 2. Keyword Search Integration
- PostgreSQL full-text search as fallback
- LIKE-based search for broader matching
- Extracts meaningful keywords from queries

### 3. Enhanced Logging & Debugging
- Detailed retrieval method tracking
- Chunk index logging for debugging
- Query expansion visibility
- Performance metrics

### 4. Debug Endpoint
- `/ai/debug-rag` endpoint for testing retrieval
- Tests multiple query variations
- Shows which methods find results
- Identifies chunk indexes retrieved

## Key Improvements

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Retrieval Methods | Vector only | Vector + Keyword + Hybrid |
| Query Processing | Direct query | Expanded queries |
| Similarity Threshold | ~0.7 | 0.2 (configurable) |
| Fallback Strategy | Recent chunks | Multiple strategies |
| Debugging | Basic logging | Comprehensive debug info |

## Testing the Fixes

### Method 1: Debug Endpoint
```bash
# Start your backend server
cd backend
npm start

# In another terminal, test the fixes
node test-rag-fix.js
```

### Method 2: Manual API Testing
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/ai/debug-rag \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer demo-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"queries": ["Where was Aryabhata born?"]}'
```

### Method 3: Chat Interface
1. Open your frontend
2. Ask: "Where was Aryabhata born?"
3. Check browser console for enhanced logging
4. Look for: `[RAG-Enhanced] Retrieved chunks: 4`

## Expected Results

With the fixes, you should now see:
- ✅ ChunkIndex 4 appears in retrieval results
- ✅ Multiple retrieval methods working (vector + keyword)
- ✅ Query expansion generating relevant variations
- ✅ Better answers about Aryabhata's birthplace

## Configuration Options

The RAG service is configurable in `server.ts`:

```typescript
const ragService = new RAGService(prisma, {
  maxResults: 5,              // Number of chunks to retrieve
  similarityThreshold: 0.2,   // Minimum similarity score
  enableKeywordSearch: true,  // Enable keyword fallback
  enableQueryExpansion: true, // Enable query rephrasing
  enableHybridSearch: true    // Combine methods
})
```

## Monitoring & Debugging

Watch the server logs for:
```
[RAG-Enhanced] Query: "Where was Aryabhata born?" | Methods: vector,keyword | Results: 3 | Keywords: aryabhata,born
[RAG-Enhanced] Retrieved chunks: 2, 4, 7
```

This confirms the system is finding your target chunk and using multiple retrieval strategies.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fixes** using the provided test script
2. **Monitor performance** in production
3. **Adjust thresholds** based on your specific content
4. **Add more query patterns** to the expansion logic if needed

The enhanced system addresses the core issue: **semantic similarity gaps between questions and content**. By combining multiple retrieval strategies and query expansion, it should now successfully find the Aryabhata birth information that was previously missed.
